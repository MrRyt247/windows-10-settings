# Windows Settings
##### [Windows 10 Interface]

## About

This was a practice to put a my flexbox and grid and a bit of JavaScript skills to a test.
It was inspired by the responsive design and hover effects of the Windows 10 Settings Homepage.

## What I learnt

- Responsive grid layout
- In-depth use of Font Awesome
- Event listeners
